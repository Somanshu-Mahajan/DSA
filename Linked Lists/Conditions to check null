int *p = 0;
*p = NULL;
//Both the above statement mean the same

if(p == 0)
if(p == NULL)
if(!p)
//These statement checks if the pointer is pointing to any node or not

if(p != 0)
if(p != NULL)
if(p)
//These statement checks if the pointer is pointing to any node

Note: This is w.r.t to C/C++. Java do not support pointers. Java does not accept 0 == null. It uses null. In Java for you to check null you have to set the object to null
