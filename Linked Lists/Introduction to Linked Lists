Linked lists stores the data of the same datatype.
Linked lists are the containers with two blocks namely data and node.
Data is the value and node is containing the memory address of next node.
If there is no node it is pointing then the value of node becomes null.

Linked List allocates memory non-contiguously.

Linked lists in C,C++:
In C you can create a structure. Create a variable with any datatype. Also create a pointer of its own type. So it is pointing towards itself. 
Such a structure is called self-referential structure.
For example: struct example{
		int data;
                struct example *next;
				 };

In C++, you can use class for linked lists.
Differnce between structure and class is, in structure everything by default is public and vice versa in class.

Linked lists in Java:
You can directly import LinkedLists class in java.util package.
It contains all the methods same as ArrayLists.
