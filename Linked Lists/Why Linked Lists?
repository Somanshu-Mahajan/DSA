The problem with arrays is with their fixed size.
We have to determine the size of the array beforehand which becomes unflexible.
We cannot increase or decrease the size of the array in the runtime.
The memory inside an array is allocated contiguosly. The array is made inside the stack memory.

Linked list advantage over arrays?
We need not declare the size beforehand.
Linked list is a variable size data structure.
It can grow or shrink on the basis of requirement.
It is created inside the heap memory.
Insertion and removal of elements is easier in linked list.
